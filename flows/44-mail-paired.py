"""Mail between two paired servers (docs/design/mail.md): `razor devices add --address` pairs them
with one key; `list` shows the other server's agents and `<name>@<server>` is admitted there with
`@<server>` in its sender; a send to that server stopped, or to one whose connections never complete
(an asleep machine's), fails saying nothing was sent, nothing is recorded as sent, and `list` names
both servers as silent. Mail from the paired server whose sender id is the recipient's parent's
is heard without the parent's header and is not among the parent's inputs at a rebuild.
Forwarded session inputs retain their person origin and request id; non-session routes, ambiguous
file paths, paired-server callers and already-forwarded requests are refused. Search and `recall` reach
b's conversations, and say `partial` when b does not answer."""
