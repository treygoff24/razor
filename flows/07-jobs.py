"""Claude Code's job shapes over Razor's shell: a background Bash, `terminal` waiting on it and
looking at it, TaskStop, and a second job stopped at its own background timeout, whose end wakes
the session (docs/design/claude.md). Then a GPT turn, in which a job's end joins the running turn
(docs/design/controller.md)."""
