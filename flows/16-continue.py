"""Mail does not reopen a finished child; continue reuses its session and branch. A child given
no model or effort runs on its parent's, not the config's defaults. A note sent to a child after
its finishing batch's last request stays unanswered, and its continuation reads it. Each request
of a twice-continued child starts with the one before, so its prompt cache is never written
again from the middle. Finished and fresh untouched rows are read directly outside the live feed."""
