"""Three reads in one model message run at once; two edits to one file apply in call order.

Each read is of a named pipe that the flow writes only after every pipe has a reader, last pipe
first, so reads run one at a time deadlock and never return. Claude's SDK returns results as
they finish (docs/design/claude.md); Razor's own loop returns them in call order (SPEC 3)."""
