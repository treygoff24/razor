"""Mail between roots on one server (docs/design/mail.md): `list` shows the other root by name and
project and not the caller; mail by name arrives under `<name> in <project>`, a reply by project
comes back, a name that is also two roots' project reaches the root of that name, a project two
roots share that is no session's name is refused with both named, and after a restart a new root
takes no name a root of this week holds."""
