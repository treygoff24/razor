"""Person messages admitted while a rebuild is under way, one while the handover's batch is still
running and one after the Rebuild entry while the rebuilt context is being answered, reach the
fresh conversation after the rebuilt context, each once, in the order they were admitted.
The first rebuilt request already includes the words held before the rebuild. A person
message still held when a newer input was sent (mail a waiting call took during the handover's
batch) is left out of the rebuilt context and reaches the model once, after it.

Admission counts what the model has not read (a parent's endless turn once refused
input at 64). A running turn admits a person's input past 64 that the model has read; the 65th it
has not read is refused, so the Responses task never holds more than 64, and mail waiting for room
is admitted when a response reads them. In a Claude turn of 66 waits, each wait's Result answers
the mail it took, and the turn's end answers every person's input, past the SDK's first 64."""
