"""Pushes to Apple's service, against a stand-in for it: `razor devices add`
prints a pairing line with the id `agents` carries, and for an IP address says what to set; a
question sends one signed alert without its words; once answered, the next pushes drop it from
the open list; a delivery, a top-level finish and a top-level failure send theirs, while a child
and a stopped turn send none; a token Apple calls gone and a removed device get nothing more; a
followed session's Live Activity updates, sends again after a restart and ends when the session
finishes; a repeated input and a repeated creation return the first answer, the input's across a
restart; each device's level and mutes filter what it gets, a root's note to the person pushes
`notify`, a finish goes at `agents` only to the device that sent its input while it has no stream
open, an alert's interruption level says whether the person is in the session, and a note too
long for a lock screen is refused."""
