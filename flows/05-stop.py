"""Escape through the API stops a foreground job on both model paths; disconnecting a client
leaves its session running and a second client replays from its cursor; a stopped job that
outlives the stop still tells the model of the stop. Ctrl-C quits the terminal app, not a
session; that check is left to flow 36 through the real terminal app."""
