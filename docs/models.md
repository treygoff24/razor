# Models and sign-in

A Claude subscription or a ChatGPT subscription is enough to run Razor; no API key is needed. Razor reaches Claude through Anthropic's Agent SDK, GPT through OpenAI's Responses API, and every other model through an OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint. Each session runs on one model at a time: switch with `/model` in the terminal app, start on one with `razor --model <name>`, or set the default with `model` in your settings. With no `model` set, new sessions start on `opus` at `high` effort.

The names in the table are the short names Razor accepts: `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku` and `fable` are Anthropic's model families, and `sol`, `terra`, `luna` and `astra` stand for OpenAI models listed under [GPT](#gpt).

| Family | Names | Sign-in | What it costs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `fable`, or a full `claude-…` id | Claude's own sign-in, run by `razor setup` (`--console` for a Console account) | Your Claude plan's usage limits; or API prices on an Anthropic Console account or key |
| GPT | `sol`, `terra`, `luna`, `astra`, or a full GPT id that `/model` lists | `razor login` | Your ChatGPT plan's usage limits; or API prices with an OpenAI API key |
| Gemini, DeepSeek, GLM | `gemini-3.8-flash`, `deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017`, `glm-5.3-flash` | An API key in the server's environment | The provider's API prices |
| Anything else | A name you choose | Its endpoint's key, or none | Whatever that endpoint charges; nothing for a model on your own machine |

Effort, how much work the model puts into each step, is `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` or `max`, set with `/effort` or `--effort`. Some chat models stop below `max`; asking for more gives them their highest.

## Claude

If Claude Code is already signed in on this machine, Razor is too: Razor runs Claude through the copy of Claude Code inside Anthropic's Agent SDK, and Claude Code keeps one sign-in for your user account, under `~/.claude` (in the login keychain on macOS). The `Claude:` line of `razor doctor` says whether it found one.

Otherwise `razor setup` runs Claude Code's sign-in, and usage counts against your Claude plan's limits. To bill an Anthropic Console account per token at API prices instead, run `razor setup --console`. If the sign-in goes missing or expires, run `razor setup` again; with a working sign-in it does not sign you in again.

There are two other ways in. Export `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` where the server starts, and Claude sessions are billed at API prices; for the background service, add it to the service as [below](#other-model-families). Or set `[claude] sign_in` to a command and its arguments, such as `sign_in = ["/home/you/bin/claude-token"]`, that prints a Claude sign-in token on its first line, and optionally an account name on its second, within 30 seconds. Razor runs it for each conversation it opens, with that conversation's session id in `RAZOR_SESSION`, so a script of yours can choose which of several Claude accounts each conversation uses. When Claude refuses the account because its organization turned off subscription access, that conversation's sign-in is dropped, and its next turn runs the command again; no restart is needed.

Claude sessions use Claude Code's own file tools, with Razor's shell in place of Claude Code's, beside Razor's own tools ([Concepts](concepts.md#tools)). Claude's own web search and fetch are always there, within your subscription; Razor's `search`, `fetch` and `answer` join them when a provider key is set.

## GPT

Sign in with your ChatGPT account:

```sh
razor login
```

It prints a link and a code: open `https://auth.openai.com/codex/device`, enter the code, and Razor saves the sign-in in `~/.razor/auth.json` and refreshes it by itself. `/login` in the terminal app does the same. This is the sign-in OpenAI's Codex uses, and usage counts against your ChatGPT plan; when the plan's limit is reached, the request fails at once rather than retrying.

The short names stand for full model ids: `sol` is `gpt-6.1-sol`, `terra` is `gpt-6.1-terra`, `luna` is `gpt-6-luna` and `astra` is `gpt-6-astra`. If you chose only ChatGPT in setup and your settings named no model, setup set `model = "sol"`.

On the sign-in, GPT runs in code mode by default, as Codex runs these models: it sees an `exec` tool that runs JavaScript against Razor's tools, so it can batch independent reads in one call, and a `wait` tool for a run that is still going. `[profiles.codex] code_mode = false` gives it plain function tools instead.

### With an OpenAI API key

To bill API use instead of a plan, put the key alone in the file `~/.razor/key`, readable only by you, and point Razor at OpenAI's public endpoint:

```sh
touch ~/.razor/key && chmod 600 ~/.razor/key
"${EDITOR:-vi}" ~/.razor/key
```

```toml
# ~/.razor/config.toml
[responses]
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
```

Run `razor restart` for `base_url` to apply ([Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#restarting-the-server)). At the public endpoint GPT uses plain function tools, and turning code mode on there is refused.

## Other model families

Every other model needs its provider's key in the server's environment, the variables the server process starts with. Razor's own key file, `keys.toml`, holds only the web search and voice keys, so these go elsewhere:

| How the server runs | Where the key goes |
| --- | --- |
| You start it with `razor serve`, or your first `razor` command starts it | Export the key in that shell first. |
| The background service, the same server registered by `razor install` with systemd or launchd so it starts at login; it sees only `PATH` and `RAZOR_HOME` | On Linux, run `systemctl --user edit razor`, add the lines below, save, and run `systemctl --user restart razor`. On macOS, add the key to `EnvironmentVariables` in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/razor.plist` and run `razor restart`; running `razor install` again rewrites that file. The service's name is its home's folder without the leading dot, `razor` for `~/.razor`. |

```ini
[Service]
Environment=GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
```

Three chat models ship with their settings filled in:

| Model | Provider | Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gemini-3.8-flash` | Google's Gemini API | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| `deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017` | RunInfra (`api.runinfra.ai`) | `RUNINFRA_API_KEY` |
| `glm-5.3-flash` | RunInfra (`api.runinfra.ai`) | `RUNINFRA_API_KEY` |

Any server that speaks OpenAI-compatible chat (`POST <base_url>/chat/completions`) works too, a local one included. Add a `[models.<name>]` table for it in your settings, then start a session on that name:

```toml
# ~/.razor/config.toml
[models.local]
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1"
id = "the-model-the-server-loaded"
window = 32768
```

```sh
razor --model local
```

`key` names the environment variable that holds the endpoint's key (`key = "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"`); with none, Razor sends no key. Set `window`, the model's context size in tokens: without it Razor cannot tell when the context is filling, so it cannot rebuild in time. A model you add gets plain file and shell tools (`read`, `write`, `edit` and `bash`, with `wait`, `send` and `kill` for running jobs) beside Razor's own; the shipped DeepSeek and GLM rows get only the shell of those. Chat models have no web tools of their own. [Configuration](configuration.md#models) lists the table's other fields.

## Checking what works

```sh
razor doctor
```

The last line names the routes Razor can run on, such as `Razor can run on Claude and GPT.` It checks Claude's sign-in, the one GPT credential `[responses] base_url` uses (the ChatGPT sign-in for the default endpoint, the key file for `https://api.openai.com/v1`), and that the web keys are present. It does not check chat models' keys, or whether a plan has usage left.
