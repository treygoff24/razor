# Protocol and types

Design page, 2026-10-27; second pass, 2026-10-28. Module `src/protocol/`, budget row "Protocol and types" (2,500 lines; first pass 605). The declarations below describe the original slice; `src/protocol/` also holds the landed children, API and model-path declarations.

`protocol` is the vocabulary the modules share: ids, the record's entries, inputs, states, job events, and the lines the API server streams. It is plain data with derived serialization. The only behaviour is making and parsing a session id, and reading the clock. Every module depends on it, and it depends on nothing else in the crate. Each JSON shape below is the wire form, used in the record file, in the API stream, in `--print stream` and on the bridge's pipe.

## Surface

```rust
// ---- ids ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// A session's id: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-xxxx`, the UTC second it started plus four random hex
/// digits. Sorts by start time as text, and holds only digits, `a`-`f` and `-`, so it is safe
/// as a directory name and in a URL path.

    /// an id once in 65,536; `Record::create` refuses the second and the caller draws again.

}
/// Refuses any string not in the format above.

/// children and residents, which are the first to need them.

/// One line of the API's event stream, and of `--print stream`: a record entry exactly as

    /// The session's state changed.
    State { state: State },
}
```

A record line and a stream line, for the reader who will parse them:

```json
{"id":4,"at":1761603303123,"kind":"call","call":"toolu_01Hx","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"ls"},"native":{"claude":{"conversation":"6c2f…","uuid":"a1b9…"}}}
{"id":5,"at":1761603303180,"kind":"result","call":"toolu_01Hx","outcome":"success","output":"a\nb\n","native":{"claude":{"conversation":"6c2f…","uuid":"77d0…"}}}
{"id":7,"at":1761603305002,"kind":"turn_end","inputs":[2,6],"end":"done","usage":{"input":1200,"output":80,"cache_read":9000,"cache_write":0}}
{"kind":"delta","text":"Two files"}
```

## Data flow

1. A client's input reaches the API server, which hands it to `Controller::admit` as an `Input`.
2. The session's controller task appends it as `Body::Input`; the record gives it an `EntryId` and an `at`.
3. A model path reports what the model did as a `Body` plus a `Native` marker (the Claude bridge sends them as JSON lines in this shape), and the controller appends each one.
4. A `Call` is appended before its action starts. On the Claude path the SDK's `PreToolUse` hook holds every call, Claude Code's own tools included, until Razor has appended it (claude-slice.md).
5. The shell reports `JobEvent`s, which the controller appends as `Body::Job`.
6. Every appended entry is published once, as its stored line, to the session's attached clients. Text deltas are published as `Live::Delta` and never appended; state changes as `Live::State`.
7. A client that attaches gets `Live::Attached` first, then the entries after its cursor. A client that falls more than the stream's buffer behind is attached again from its cursor, so it gets `Attached` (with the state now) and the entries it missed; what it loses is only deltas.
8. The record file, the API stream and `--print stream` therefore carry the same entry lines, so the flows, the terminal app and the web app all read one schema.
9. `recall` returns an entry's stored line, unchanged, except a `Thinking` entry: the model's own reasoning handed back to it is refused upstream as reasoning extraction (Claude, 2026-10-29), so recall answers that entry with one sentence instead.
10. Nothing in `protocol` touches a file or a socket.

## The hard decision: what the API's event stream is

The choice is between one event per record entry and a separate projection made for clients. **Decision: the stream carries record entries verbatim, plus three live kinds that are never stored (`attached`, `delta`, `state`).**

- **Entries only.** The stream is the record and nothing else.
  - Writer: appending and publishing are the same act.
  - Reader: one schema.
  - Crash: a reattach replays exactly.
  - Cost: text reaches a client only when a whole content block completes, which on Claude can be paragraphs and seconds of nothing on screen. The state is never said; every client must work it out from the entries.
- **A separate projection** (message started, delta, tool started, tool finished, state).
  - Writer: a mapping per entry kind, plus a second schema to version. Every new entry kind needs a projection rule, which is a second definition of the same concept (RULES.md 5).
  - Reader: clients learn a shape the record does not have, and the flows must check two formats.
  - Crash: the projection has to be rebuilt from the record anyway, so it is either derived (the first option plus a mapping) or stored (a second log).
  - Later changes: two schemas move with every change.
- **The choice: entries plus three live kinds.**
  - Writer: the controller publishes exactly the line it appended, serialized once, and only three kinds are added.
  - Reader: one schema plus three kinds, the same lines the record file holds.
  - Crash, disconnect or overrun: one rule, attach from the cursor. It replays the record exactly and re-sends the state in `attached`; only deltas are lost, and each is superseded by its `Text` entry.
  - Later changes: a new entry kind reaches every client with no API change.
  - Cost: the record's line format becomes public API, versioned under `/v1`. Accepted, because the record's shape changes rarely and on purpose.

## Per-conversation account usage

`AgentView.usage: Vec<UsageWindow>` replaces the controller-wide `Limit` and `Live::Limit`. Each row holds at most 32 windows for its native conversation's sign-in, cleared when that conversation reopens. `FromBridge::Usage { windows }` replaces those readings as one snapshot; nothing is recorded or combined across sessions.

```rust
/// One account window: absent utilization is unknown, never a measured zero.
pub struct UsageWindow {
    pub name: String,                  // 5-hour, 7-day, or the server's model label
    pub utilization: Option<f64>,      // percent, 0–100 on both routes
    pub resets_at: Option<Millis>,
    pub rejected: bool,               // a reached limit produces an alert
}
```

A window is stale once `resets_at` has passed; there is no separate reading timestamp or SDK status string.

`Models.windows: BTreeMap<String, u64>` carries the profile table's known context windows so the client can draw an empty selected model's gauge without guessing Claude's window.

## Second pass: keep the declarations plain

The public types, variants, fields, functions and JSON forms stay unchanged. Session ids take their UTC date from jiff, which the crate already depends on; a new id is made once per session, so its formatting cost does not matter, and its bytes and ordering match the earlier hand-written calculation from 1970 through 2100. A macro for repeated derives would hide the declarations every module reads; it would shorten the count, not the design.

Remove only work with no caller-visible effect: serialize `SessionId` directly as its newtype string instead of cloning it through `String`, remove redundant defaults on optional fields, and simplify re-exports and the single-cause error display. Remove `IMAGE_TYPES`, which no code in `src/`, `bridge/`, `flows/` references; the MIME strings on the wire stay unchanged. Keep the consuming `From<SessionId> for String` conversion public. No caller changes, dependencies or new vocabulary are needed. Compare serialized bytes for every record and wire variant, round-trip records produced by the binary, and run the same numbered flows before and after.

## A child's kind is not a protocol type

Trey, 2026-10-29: a reviewer or researcher differs from a worker only in the role text its first input carries, which the record already holds (`docs/design/children.md`). So `Child` loses `kind`, which nothing read after the start, and `ChildKind` leaves `src/protocol/children.rs` for a private enum in `src/children/agent.rs`, the one place that parses it. A record written before keeps parsing, since `Child` ignores a field it does not name.

## Glossary lines proposed

- **native conversation**: a model path's own conversation inside a session (on the Claude path, the SDK's). A rebuild starts a new one, and the record names it on each entry it mirrors.
- **cursor**: the id of the last entry a client has read. Attaching after it replays the rest.
